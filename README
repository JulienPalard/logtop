This project is tested on 32 and 64 bits platforms.

Usage :
  logtop displays real-time count of strings recieved in standard input.
  I's useful for some cases, like :
  tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log \
    | sed -u -r 's/^([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) \[([^]]+)] "([^ ]+) ([^"]+) HTTP\/([^"]+)" ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) "([^"]+)" "([^"]+)"$/\6/g' \
    | logtop
  to show the top pages requested on your apache
  I'd put parenthesis everywhere to allow you to switch the selection :
   1: ip
   2: date
   5: method
   6: url
   7: version
   8: status
   9: length
   10: referer
   11: useragent
)

Compile (Dependencies) :
  Package: libavl-dev
    Version: 0.3.5-3
  Package: libncurses5-dev
    Version: 5.7+20100313-1

Development :
  I use AVL trees to store strings and counts, so i can fetch by string AND
  fetch ordered to display the top-strings. A simple ordered list can do the
  trick for the counts.

TODO :
  Better integration with curses (resize...)
