This project is tested on 32 and 64 bits platforms.

Compile (Dependencies) :
  Package: libavl-dev
    Version: 0.3.5-3
  Package: libncurses5-dev
    Version: 5.7+20100313-1

Development :
  I use AVL trees to store strings and counts, so i can fetch by string AND
  fetch ordered to display the top-strings. A simple ordered list can do the
  trick for the counts.

TODO :
  Better integration with curses (resize...)
